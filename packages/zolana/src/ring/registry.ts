 * Every ring registered with the shielded pool.
 *
 * A ring's own config lives under its own program, so rings cannot be
 * enumerated from there -- each one is a separate program and you would have to
 * know its address already. The pool keeps a config of its own per ring, and
 * the pool is a single known program, so that side is the directory.
 *
 * This is the list to offer a depositor. A paused ring still appears: hiding it
 * would leave a wallet holding balance there unable to see where it is, and a
 * caller choosing a deposit target should filter on `paused` deliberately.
 *
 * The list is complete or the call throws, so an empty array means the pool has
 * no rings registered and never that the registry could not be read. An RPC
 * that refuses `getProgramAccounts`, which some providers do, raises
 * `CLIENT_UNSUPPORTED_RPC_METHOD`; a returned account that does not decode
 * raises `CLIENT_INVALID_RPC_RESPONSE`, because the size and discriminator
 * filters already asked for ring configs and nothing else, so a record that is
 * not one means the response did not honour the query and the accounts that did
 * decode are no more trustworthy than the one that did not. A caller that would
 * rather degrade than fail catches the `ClientError` and decides for itself
 * what an unreadable registry should show.
 *
 * The size filter pins this to the current `RingConfig` layout: a program that
 * changes the account's size needs `RING_CONFIG_SIZE` changed with it, or rings
 * written in the new layout stop being listed.
