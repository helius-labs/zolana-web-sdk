# Architecture and Security Contract for the `@heliuslabs/zolana` TS SDK

This contract is binding for every change under `sdk-libs/ts`. Its normative
terms are literal requirements. Preserve system invariants, not merely passing
tests. Weakening a gate, decoder, type, error, or allowlist to admit a change is
a defect.

## Non-negotiable invariants

- The SDK MUST NOT silently lose wallet state, advance past unrepresented
  chain data, expose secrets, authorize unintended value movement, emit a
  transaction known to be invalid, or claim a public API the package does not
  export.
- Security and correctness paths MUST fail closed. Unsupported, ambiguous,
  malformed, stale, partially decoded, or unauthenticated state is an error,
  never an empty result, default value, successful sync, or best-effort skip.
- Every invariant MUST have one implementation owner and adversarial tests at
  the boundary where it can fail. Copying policy is forbidden.
- Probabilistic filters, caches, and heuristics may optimize the average path
  only. They MUST NOT decide correctness or authorization. Every adversarial
  hit/miss has a deterministic, bounded escape hatch, even if it costs more.

## Architecture and dependency direction

- Dependencies flow from protocol primitives to transaction and domain logic,
  then shared flows, wallet and ring orchestration, client adapters, and public
  barrels. Lower layers MUST NOT import concrete clients or orchestration.
- `test/boundaries.test.ts` is the executable layer map. Change it only with a
  documented architectural reason. Never add an exception for convenience.
- Capability contracts and their DTOs live in `src/client/ports.ts`. A port
  MUST NOT import `client.ts`. Public builders accept the smallest named port
  composition they use, never `ZolanaClient`, broad facades, or structural
  bags with unrelated capabilities.
- Concrete clients implement ports. Domain code depends on ports. Transport,
  selection, settlement, compilation, retry, persistence, and error policy
  each have one shared implementation. No rail-specific fork may duplicate
  them.
- A module MUST NOT reach through another layer's internal file. Promote a
  narrow contract or move the shared concept to its rightful owner. Cycles and
  barrel imports inside implementation code are forbidden.

## Types are proofs, not decoration

- Production code MUST NOT use `any`, `as unknown as`, unchecked branded
  casts, generic `fake<T>`/`cast<T>` helpers, or assertions that manufacture a
  capability. Tests receive no exemption.
- `unknown` is required at an untrusted boundary and MUST disappear through a
  runtime decoder. Inside trusted domain code, pervasive `unknown`, broad
  records, and optional-method probing indicate a missing type or port.
- A branded value may be asserted only immediately after the runtime invariant
  that proves the brand. Keep the assertion local and name the invariant.
- Type predicates claim exactly what they check. Partial validation MUST yield
  a partial type. Prefer discriminated unions, exhaustive switches,
  `satisfies`, and typed fixture builders with explicit defaults.
- Public structural signed/request objects MUST be revalidated at the method
  boundary. Callers can construct interfaces without using SDK builders.

## Public and release surface

- `package.json.exports` plus the emitted `.d.ts` files define the API. Source
  exports and deep internal paths do not. Every promised symbol MUST be
  importable from a supported package subpath.
- Public DTOs belong beside their public port. No public declaration may
  reference an unexported, concrete, or `@internal` type.
- Every public change updates `CHANGELOG.md` under `CHANGELOG-RULES.md` in the
  same branch. The packed artifact is truth. Prose, source barrels, and commit
  titles are not.
- REQUIRED gates for public changes: `npm run check`, `npm pack --dry-run`, and
  a consumer fixture importing the packed subpath with `skipLibCheck: false`.
  `check:dist` alone does not prove named exports exist.
- Only the current package version may be `unreleased`. Historical unpublished
  versions use their bump date. Published versions use the registry date.
- Release order is fixed: set `package.json` version, date the matching
  changelog entry, run `npm run check`, publish, then push
  `ts-sdk-v<version>`. Never tag or document an artifact not verified above.

## Untrusted input and transport

- RPC, HTTP, JSON, storage, and deserialized values remain `unknown` until a
  decoder accepts exact shape, range, encoding, and semantics. Reuse
  `src/interface/decode.ts` with the owning layer's error factory.
- Addresses, signatures, hashes, cursors, keys, base58/base64, integers, and
  enums MUST be validated canonically. Numeric conversion MUST prove safe
  range before `Number(...)`. Responses MUST be correlated with the request.
- Do not catch decode failures and continue unless the protocol explicitly
  defines that item as ignorable and progress remains replayable. Filtered RPC
  scans MUST distinguish “unsupported/failed” from “successfully empty”.
- Every external I/O path MUST propagate `RequestContext` cancellation and
  deadline. HTTPS policy, redirect refusal, size caps, content type, timeouts,
  canonical JSON-RPC envelopes, and sanitized failures belong to the shared
  transport and MUST NOT be bypassed.
- Error details MUST NOT expose response bodies, credentials, URL queries,
  request witnesses, decrypted plaintext, or server-controlled text.

## Wallet sync, cursors, and persistence

- Sync is a transaction: read into a session clone, validate the complete
  result, then commit exactly once through `_commitSync` on the wallet queue.
  Any failure leaves rows, UTXOs, registry, nullifiers, timestamps, and cursors
  unchanged.
- A cursor is a durable commit record, not a paging optimization. It may advance
  only when every fetched item before it is durably represented in wallet
  state or durably retained for deterministic replay.
- Unknown assets, failed/unsupported registry backfill, undecoded owned data,
  incomplete follow-up reads, or unresolved dependencies MUST prevent cursor
  commit. Returning diagnostics while committing past the data is forbidden.
- Cursors remain separate per stream and per stable tag/nullifier. A newly
  learned key starts at its own beginning. Another key's watermark MUST NOT be
  reused. Terminal empty pages advance only from an authoritative
  `scannedThrough` value.
- Snapshot encoding has one owner:
  `src/transaction/wallet/persistence.ts`. Deserialization validates everything
  and supports every shipped version. Migrations are explicit and tested.
- `syncPersistedWallet` is the only sync+save composition. Sync, serialization,
  and save run in the same wallet queue. Save occurs only after commit. Store
  replacement MUST be atomic. Cross-process safety is not implied: one stored
  snapshot has one writer unless an explicit CAS/lease protocol is added.

## Concurrency and reservations

- UTXO selection and reservation form one synchronous state transition.
  Concurrent builds on one wallet MUST NOT select the same UTXO.
- Every failure after reservation MUST release it in `finally` or the owning
  error boundary. Success retains it until confirmation, sync-observed spend,
  explicit cancellation, or documented expiry.
- In-memory queues and reservations MUST NOT be described as distributed
  locks. Crash recovery guarantees require the reservation-bearing snapshot
  to be durably saved and tested.

## Secrets, authorization, and intent

- Secret access is capability-scoped and callback-bounded. Do not return or
  cache borrowed keys. Temporary byte buffers are wiped and temporary key
  objects destroyed in `finally` on success, rejection, and thrown callbacks.
- Ownership transfer of a secret MUST be explicit: clear the local owner before
  cleanup so failure paths wipe exactly once. Avoid immutable secret
  projections. `bigint` cannot be wiped. A required prover scalar is the narrow
  exception and MUST NOT escape its proof lifetime.
- Never log, stringify, serialize, clone unnecessarily, place in error details,
  or branch with ordinary equality on secrets. Use constant-time comparison
  where secrecy is relevant.
- User approval binds a canonical `TransactionIntent`. The final proved and
  compiled transaction MUST be revalidated against that intent immediately
  before return. Approval summaries are display data, never authorization.
- All derived keys, nonces, domain separators, tree/ring identifiers, assets,
  amounts, recipients, settlements, and signer sets MUST be bound at the layer
  that authorizes or proves them.

## Errors and observability

- Every expected failure has a stable code from its owning layer's closed
  taxonomy. No bare strings, generic `Error`, server messages, or catch-all
  codes at public boundaries.
- A boundary preserves its outer operation code and records sanitized inner
  codes in `causeCode`/`causeCodes`. It MUST NOT erase the operation context or
  leak the original cause through JSON or enumeration.
- Never convert “cannot know” into `false`, `[]`, zero, or absence when callers
  could mistake it for an authoritative answer.

## Verification discipline

- A bug fix MUST include a regression that fails before the fix and asserts
  both the result and forbidden side effects. Atomicity tests inspect all state
  that must remain unchanged. Security tests exercise every throw path.
- Wire/protocol behavior shared with Rust MUST use common constants or pinned
  cross-language vectors. A TS convenience MUST NOT redefine protocol truth.
- Run `npm run check` before handoff. Run relevant live E2E for changed network
  flows and state explicitly when it was not run. Never delete, skip, loosen,
  or whitelist a failing test to make a change pass.
