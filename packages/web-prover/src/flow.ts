/**
 * What the PoC measures, split into two benchmarks with very different
 * infrastructure needs.
 *
 * 1. `benchmarkShapeKeys` -- per-shape proving-key fetch and deserialization.
 *    Needs only the key files, no validator, no indexer, no notes. This is the
 *    cold-start cost of local proving and it is the number that decides whether
 *    browser proving is usable at all, so it must be runnable on its own.
 *
 * 2. `runFlow` -- one real shield -> transfer -> unshield round trip against a
 *    running stack, with real proofs. "Shield" is the SDK's `deposit`, "unshield"
 *    is `withdraw`.
 *
 * The two are kept apart because a synthetic per-shape prove benchmark is not
 * possible: Groth16 needs a satisfiable witness, so a prove timing for shape NxM
 * only exists if the wallet actually held N spendable notes. The UI labels which
 * shapes got real prove numbers rather than implying a full matrix.
