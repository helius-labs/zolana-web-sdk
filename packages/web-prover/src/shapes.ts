/**
 * The transfer circuit shapes and the proving keys that back them.
 *
 * The shape list mirrors `SPP_SUPPORTED_SHAPES` in the SDK, `SupportedShapes` in
 * `prover-test/spp/protocol/shape.go`, and the on-chain verifier -- smallest
 * capacity first, so the order doubles as the smallest-fit search order.
 *
 * The sizes below exist only so the UI can total them before fetching anything.
 * `keys/manifest.json`, generated from `proving-keys.lock` by `just poc-keys`, is
 * what a downloaded key is actually validated against -- a key rotation changes
 * every size and digest, and a copy in source silently goes stale across a
 * rebase.
